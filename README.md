I am currently a second year PhD student at University of Bristol, UK. I once worked as a full-time system engineer at Philips R&D (Suzhou). I graduated with a research master's degree in Medical Robotics from Imperial College London. I am interested in healthcare innovation, medical robotics and AI.
